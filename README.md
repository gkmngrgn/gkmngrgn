# HELLO ðŸ‘‹

I'm **GoeDev**, living in Berlin, but sometimes I visit Ankara. I'm working as a Software Engineer at [Mimi](https://github.com/MimiHearingTechnologies) and coding in hearing technologies.

If you like my projects, you can support and motivate me. Sometimes I plan to open LiveCoding streams on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/goedev). It depends on you.
